## Purdue CS307 project: Theo Burkhart, Todd Griffin, Justin Hartman, Tyler Rex, Mason Wesolek

As part of a software engineering course during my sophomore year, a team of 4 other students and I worked to create a quiz platform for classrooms and lectures. Our goal was to replace the current iClicker system used by Purdue. Quack includes a powerful web app that allows instructors to organize all their courses, create quizzes, and manage grades. Students are able to then take these quizzes on their iOS or Android device, with live results viewable by the instructor. Our backend was built using GraphQL, Node.js/Express, and Microsoft Azure. The web app was built in React and the mobile apps were built using React Native to maxamize code reusability.
